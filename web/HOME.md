# Unofficial VFSC Companies Graph

This application is an **unofficial** graph of the [Vanuatu Financial Services Commission](https://www.vfsc.vu).

I repeat, this is strictly an **unofficial** and **unrelated** project of the VFSC which does not claim to represent actual facts and should not be used by anyone for any purpose.

#### For Your Information

This data is collected by reading the publicly available companies data from the VFSC website.
Due to limitations of this data collection method you may find some company names missing or some individuals multiple times under different spellings of their name.
This is a consequence of how VFSC stores their data and then presents their data for the public to read so without a lot manual labor I can not always catch and fix these.

Due to the method of reading the source data it is likely what you see here is out of date and that is just one more reason not to use this website.


#### So, Why Make This?

I wanted to have a project to learn to use [Playwright](#) with [Scrapy](#) and to take a step away from SPAs and modern frameworks for a minute and build something with just [Flask](#) and [Vanilla JavaScript](#).
